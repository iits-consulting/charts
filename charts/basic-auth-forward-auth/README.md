# basic-auth-forward-auth

![Version: 0.2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.2.0-informational?style=flat-square)

For workshop we use this chart to establish a basic auth forward auth.
OIDC forward auth would be to complicated to implement.
But since we use the name "oidc-forward-auth" inside every ingress annotation as a middleware we named the basic auth
middleware also like this.
