If you use the Gateway API with traefik you should update your CRD's. 

If you use our [crd-installer](https://github.com/iits-consulting/terraform-opentelekomcloud-project-factory/tree/master/modules/crd_installer) 
you can either manually update the chart version to `29.0.1` or use a newer version of the crd-installer itself.

If you are not using the Gateway API, no additional changes are necessary.
