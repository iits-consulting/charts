## 1.0.x -> 1.1.0

üí• **Breaking changes** üí•

 - New flag `clusterIssuer.useStaging` (default `true`)
   - Reason: Prevent hitting the ratelimit on letsencrypt prod environment. 
   - Action: Set to `false` after verifying the content of the test-certificate.
 - Moved field `clusterIssuer.http.email` to `clusterIssuer.email`
   - Reason: Added a new clusterIssuer for DNS01 challenges, prevent field duplication.
   - Action: Move existing config to `clusterIssuer.email`
 - Moved field: `clusterIssuer.http.name` to `clusterIssuer.http01.name`
     - Reason: Adding a new clusterIssuer for DNS01 challenges
     - Action: If overriden, move existing config to `clusterIssuer.http01.name`
 - Moved field `ingressClass` to `clusterIssuer.http01.ingressClass`
   - Reason: As this only applies to the http-issuer, it is moved to better reflect it's context
   - Action: If overriden, move existing config to `clusterIssuer.http01.ingressClass`

üéâ **New functionality** üéâ
- ClusterIssuer for DNS01 Challenges on OTC
  - Set `clusterIssuer.dns01.enabled` to `true` to enable
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Only configured for OTC
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires the chart [cert-manager-webhook-opentelekomcloud](https://github.com/akyriako/cert-manager-webhook-opentelekomcloud)
    - Use the projectfactory-terraform module `cert-manager` for autoconfiguration

**Other changes**
- Dropped the deployment count of `cert-manager` back to its default value (1)
  - Reason: cert-manager requires a lease against `kube-system/cert-manager-controller` so only single Pod can function at a time anyway
