This chart deploys common `CustomResourceDefinitions` for iits-consulting only projects.
With this we avoid a typical catch-22, e.g. where you can not use `traefik`
`IngressRoute` before you deploy `traefik` and such.
You could also use sync-waves and other mechanism, but it creates a lot of complexity
and a huge dependency graph.
